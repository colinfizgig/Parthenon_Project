			<div class='tourTitle'>The Pylons Front Gate</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>1.  Before visitors enter the Acropolis, they first go through the pylon, or the front gate.</li><li>2.  Notice that the pylon is made up of two towers, joined together by a lower section in the middle that includes the entrance to travel through the pylon.</li><li>3.  The word "pylon" is the Greek term to refer to a monumental gateway that leads to an Egyptian temple. Usually the two towers in pylons have cornices, or decorative moldings, at their tops. Also, the lower section that connects the two towers, is generally about half the height of the towers.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>
		<div id="tourStop2" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>The Central Ramp</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>1.	 Here, we see a central ramp in between two staircases. The stairs were for pedestrians while the central ramp was used for processions.</li><li>2.	The building up ahead is called the Propylaea. Notice that the Propylaea is at a difficult location, since it sits atop this steep slope.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>
		<div id="tourStop3" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>Introduction of</br>the Propylaea</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>1.  This building is the Propylaea. In general, the word “Propylaea” refers to huge entranceways that will lead into another space. Just like the Propylaea of the Acropolis, propylaeas in general usually lead to temples or religious parts of a city. The Propylaea of the Acropolis of Athens is the most famous and best preserved example of a propylaea.</li><li>2.  Athens’ Propylaea is made up of a huge, grand hall, which we can enter through the front six pillars here.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>
		<div id="tourStop4" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>The Propylaea’s</br>Ceiling and Pillars</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>1.  The ceiling of the Propylaea was painted in order to depict a heavenly scene, with gold stars on a dark blue background.</li><li>2.	 We also see that the roof of the Propylaea is supported with two rows of Ionic columns, one row on the left and one on the right of this pathway. Each row consists of three columns.</li><li>3.  Unfortunately, much of the Propylaea today is damaged. In the mid 17th century CE, the gunpowder stored in the Propylaea may be have been ignited via either a canon shot or perhaps a lightning strike, which caused an explosion and heavily damaged the building that we see today.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>
		<div id="tourStop5" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>The Pinakotheke</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>1.	The area to the left side of the Propylaea is known as the Pinakotheke, which means “picture gallery.” The Pinakotheke initially functioned as a banquet hall, but was then converted into a gallery area for paintings and frescoes. The walls were once decorated with painted compositions, which may have been frescoes or hanging pictures. Interestingly though, ancient manuscripts indicate the Pinakotheke housed separate easel works instead of frescoes.</li><li>2.	 Additionally, the content of these images were created to honor the gods. One artwork from the Pinakotheke that survived is the “Achilles on Sykros,” painted by Polygnotus.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>
		<div id="tourStop6" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>The Right side</br>or the South wing</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>1.	 The right side, or the south wing of the Propylaea is smaller than the left wing, since the Temple of Athena Nike was also built on the right side.</li><li>2.	It is likely that the right wing was constructed only to maintain symmetry in the Propylaea.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>
		<div id="tourStop7" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>The Pedestal with</br>the Four-Horse Chariot</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>1.  Here, in front of the Propylaea, we see this huge pedestal made up of grey Hymettus marble. Atop this 29 feet, or 10 meter high pedestal, sits a sculpture of a four-horse chariot. This sculpture is also called a “quadriga sculpture” and was built to honor the king of Pergamon, Eumenes II, after he won the Panthenaic Games in 178 BCE.</li><li>2.	Later, during the 1st century CE, this pedestal was re-purposed to hold the statues of Anthony and Cleopatra. After these sculptures collapsed during a hurricane in 31 CE, in 35 CE, the monument was re-dedicated to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. Agrippa was considered as a very important benefactor to Athens.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>
		<div id="tourStop8" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>Introduction of</br>the Athena Nike</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>1.	 On the southwest corner of the Acropolis, right next to the Propylaea, is the Temple of the Athena Nike. This temple was built with two main purposes in mind. One, to honor Athena Nike, the goddess of victory, and second, to display as a symbol Athens’ political and military power. This temple also replaced a smaller temple which was previously destroyed during the Persian wars.</li><li>2.  The Athena Nike saw the completion of its construction in 420 BCE, during the High Classical Period. Interestingly, Athena Nike’s architect is Kallikrates, the same architect who designed the Parthenon.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>
		<div id="tourStop9" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>About the Location</br>of the Athena Nike</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>1.  Notice that the Temple of Athena Nike is located at the edge of a very high cliff.</li><li>2.  Although this position is highly susceptible to attacks, it is also placed well in order to strengthen the defense around the Acropolis. As a result, the location of this temple is also very suitable for worshiping the goddess of victory, Athena.</li><li>3.  The location of the Athena Nike is also significant in that even before the temple was constructed, archaeological evidence shows that the location was already utilized during the Mycenaean age, to conduct religious rituals. At the time, Mycenaeans has also built the first defensive bastion at this location, the remaining fragments of which are preserved in the temple’s basement.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>
		<div id="tourStop10" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>The Inside of</br>the Athena Nike</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>1.	Just like all other Greek temples, the inside of the Temple of Athena Nike would have held a cult statue. The Temple of Athena Nike once stored a wooden statue of Athena. One interesting thing is that although Greek mythology often depicts Nike deities as having wings, the statue of Athena does not have wings. The ancient Greek writer Pausanias explains that this was done so that Athena could never leave Athens. As a result, the statue of Athena in this temple is nicknamed “wingless victory”.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>
		<div id="tourStop11" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>Exiting the Propylaia</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>1.	Here, you could exit the Propylaea from the back, through five possible openings. The widest of these openings was used during the Panathenaea procession. This procession was held during Panathenaic Games, which were conducted every four years in Athens.</li><li>2.  As we exit the Propylaea, visitors would first be greeted by the “Athena Promachos”, a 9 meter bronze statue that was created to celebrate Athen’s victories against the Persions. This statue is so tall that sailors could actually see it from Cape Sounion, which is about 45 miles away from the south east. Today, the Athena Promachos no longer exists, as Emperor Justinian from the 6th century had ordered for the statue to be taken to the city Constantinople. The statue was then destroyed in a fire.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopE1" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>The Erechtheion</br>Eastern Cella</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>The eastern part of the Erechtheion is known as the Temple to Athena Polias. As the Erechtheion is an Ionic temple, the columns are more slender and decorative than those of the Parthenon, which is a Doric temple. One can see that the columns are glass inlaid, have gold around the bases, and grow slightly more slender as they near the top.  Here, one can enter the shallow eastern cella. This room is a shrine to the olivewood statue of Athena.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopE2" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>Olivewood statue</br>of Athena</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>This statue of Athena was said to be dropped from the heavens. It’s made out of olivewood and is simple and harsh. It contrasts with the Athena Parthenos which stands in the Parthenon and is intricate and detailed.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopE3" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>Ruins of the Old</br>Temple of Athena</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>The Erechtheion was built between the Old Temple of Athena and the edge of the cliff.</li><li>The first endeavour to build a sanctuary for Athena Parthenos on the site of the present Parthenon was begun shortly after the Battle of Marathon (c. 490–488 BC) upon a solid limestone foundation that extended and levelled the southern part of the Acropolis summit. This building replaced a hekatompedon (meaning "hundred-footer") and would have stood beside the archaic temple dedicated to Athena Polias ("of the city"). The Older or Pre-Parthenon, as it is frequently referred to, was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC and razed the Acropolis.</li><li>Here, one can see the ruins of the old temple</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopE4" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>Porch of the Caryatids</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>The Porch of the Caryatids, also known as the Porch of the Maidens was said to be built over the grave of Kekrops, a legendary king of Athens. It is an enclosed porch and is supposedly the visible portion of the grave. Each of the maidens stands in contrapposto with one locked leg and the other bent showing motion. The locked leg is always towards the outside in order to show stability. Each of the maidens’ hair is also knotted at the back of their necks in order to provide extra stability.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopE5" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>Olive tree Athena</br>gave as an offering</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>Looking at the west side of the Erechtheion, one can see the where the olive tree that Athena once offered to the city still stands. This offering was what won her competition against Poseidon and thus, the city, Athens, was named after her.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopE6" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>The Erechtheion</br>North Porch</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>The North Porch is supported by six columns. Around the top, blue marble friese was used in the original architecture which complemented the white/ cream pentelic marble. It also boasts detailed entablature which created continuity around the building.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopE7" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>Poseidon's Spring</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>This is the hole in the floor that shows the mark on the bedrock below that was supposedly left when Poseidon’s trident struck it and created a saltwater spring. This was his offering to the city in his contest with Athena, which he lost, to be the patron of the city.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopE8" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>Hole in the ceiling</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>Here is the hole in the ceiling where Poseidon’s trident came through to strike the bedrock. It is also where Zeus’ thunderbolt came down and struck and killed King Erechtheius.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopE9" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>Grand stairway</br>leading to</br>the  North Porch</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>This is the grand stairway that leads to the north porch and a large outdoor area dedicated to Zeus.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopE10" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>Erechtheion Courtyard</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>This is a large courtyard type area dedicated to Zeus which is in front of the North Porch.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopP1" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>The Parthenon</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>This is the Parthenon, the Temple of Athena Parthenos as well as the treasury of Athens.  The Entrance to the Left is the Eastern Door to the Sanctuary of Athena Parthenos.  The Entrance to the Right is the Western door and the entrance to the Treasury of Athens.</li><li>The Parthenon itself replaced an older temple of Athena, the ruins of which lay between the Parthenon and the Erechtheion behind you. The original temple was destroyed in the Persian invasion of 480 BC.</li><li>Like most Greek temples, the Parthenon served a practical purpose as the city treasury. For a time, it served as the treasury of the Delian League, which later became the Athenian Empire. In the final decade of the sixth century AD, the Parthenon was converted into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopP2" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>The Naos</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>The Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture. The temple, wrote John Julius Cooper, "enjoys the reputation of being the most perfect Doric temple ever built. Even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the naos walls and the entasis of the columns." Entasis refers to the slight swelling, of 4 centimetres, in the centre of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples, it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on, they would meet almost exactly a mile above the centre of the Parthenon.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopP3" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>The Athena Parthenos</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>"Athena the Virgin" is a lost massive chryselephantine (gold and ivory) sculpture of the Greek goddess Athena, made by Phidias and his assistants and housed in the Parthenon in Athens. Despite the dynamic architectural characteristics of the Parthenon, the statue of Athena was designed to be the focal point. Its epithet was an essential character of the goddess herself.</li><li>The ancient historian Pausanias gave a description of the statue: "...The statue is created with ivory and gold. On the middle of her helmet is likeness of the Sphinx ... and on either side of the helmet are griffins in relief. ... The statue of Athena is upright, with a tunic reaching to the feet, and on her breast the head of Medusa is worked in ivory. She holds a statue of Victory that is approx. four cubits high, and in the other hand a spear; at her feet lies a shield and near the spear is a serpent. This serpent would be Erichthonius.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopP4" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>The Opisthodomos</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>This smaller room of the Parthenon was most likely used as a treasury for Athens.  It has long been known that at least part of the ancient city-state’s money was stored in the Acropolis, but no record from the period, the fifth century BCE, specifies exactly where.</li><li>One historical record, mentioned the amount of 3,000 talents being stored in the Acropolis. One talent was equal to 1,500 tetradrachms, and the tetradrachm was the coin with the highest denomination at the time. This means that just this one “cargo” consisted of 4.5 million tetradrachms with a total weight of 78 metric tonnes. In other historical documents, authors mention that the Acropolis coin storage sometimes held up to 10,000 talents, which would have weighed 260 tonnes. </li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopP5" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>The Athena Promachos</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>The Athena Promachos ("Athena who fights in the front line") was a colossal bronze statue of Athena sculpted by Pheidias, which stood between the Propylaea and the Parthenon on the Acropolis. Descriptions of the statue list its height at 10 meters tall.</li><li>Erected around 456 BCE, the Athena Promachos was either to memorialize the Battle of Marathon or the Persian Wars which is possibly what the dedicatory inscription refers to; This inscription also mentions that the trophies won in the Persian War were once placed around the pedestal of the statue. It took somewhere near nine years to construct.</li><li>Athena Promachos stood overlooking her city for approximately 1000 years, until shortly after 465 CE, when the sculpture was transported to Constantinople as a trophy in the "Oval Forum" of the Eastern Roman Empire. Niketas Choniates documented a riot taking place in the Forum of Constantine in Constantinople in 1203 CE where a large, bronze, statue of Athena was destroyed by a “drunken crowd” of Crusaders which is now thought to have been the Athena Promachos.</li></ul></div></div>
		</div>

		<div id="tourStopP6" class="tourStop">
			<div class='tourTitle'>The Brauroneion</br>Sanctuary of Artemis</br><div class='tourContent'><ul><li>The Brauroneion was the sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia on the Athenian Acropolis, located in the southwest corner of the Acropolis plateau, between the Chalkotheke and the Propylaia in Greece. It was originally dedicated during the reign of Peisistratos. Artemis Brauronia, protector of women in pregnancy and childbirth</li><li>The sanctuary on the Acropolis was of an unusual trapezoidal shape and did not contain a formal temple. Instead, a portico or stoa served that function. The stoa measured circa 38 by 6.8 m; it stood in front of the southern Acropolis wall, facing north.</li><li>One of the wings contained the wooden cult statue (xoanon) of the goddess. Women who petitioned Artemis for help habitually dedicated items of clothing, which were draped around the statue. In 346 BC, a second cult statue was erected. According to Pausanias, it was a work by Praxiteles.</li></ul></div></div>
